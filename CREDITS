TinyMUSH 3 Credits
==================

TinyMUSH 3.0 is a derivation/merger of TinyMUSH 2.2.5 and TinyMUX 1.6,
with some additional extensive code revisions, bugfixing, and feature
enhancements. 

The original TinyMUSH 3.0 development team consisted of Lydia Leong
("Amberyl") and David Passmore ("Lauren"); Robby Griffin ("Alierak")
joined at 3.0 beta 18, and Scott Dorr ("Myrddin") joined at 3.0 beta 23.
The server is now being maintained and enhanced by all four developers.

With the stable release of TinyMUSH 3.1, Eddy Beaupré ("Tyr") has
joined the team and is working on the migration to Sourceforge.

In addition to the lots of people we've already thanked from earlier
work on the servers, we'd like to make special note of:

- Deborah Wilson-Hooker ("Ysabel"), who prodded us in the direction of
  doing a lot of neat things that we eventually didn't incorporate, in
  the interests of a faster time-to-release, but which we're nonetheless
  grateful for.

- The members of the Gods, Softcode, TinyMUX, Hogs, and Tinymush-Unoff
  lists, for ongoing support and patience, as well as bug reports and
  new feature requests. Adam Dray, Brazil, Soruk, and Talek deserve
  special thanks here, also.

- The various people who helped us in the initial phases of the alpha
  test, loaned us hardware to do compiles on, and otherwise donated us
  time and equipment.

- Our Godlike partner-in-crime Fred Hicks ("Iago"), and the Godlike
  customers who volunteered for the alpha test, and the players of our
  initial alpha test games (From the Ashes, Blood of Amber, and
  Babylon 5: The Last Best Hope).

- Many other people who may go unnamed. Dozens of people have contributed to
  development of the TinyMU* family of servers, and we would like to thank
  them for their hard work.

TinyMUX Credits
===============

TinyMUX 1.0 is derived from TinyMUSH 2.0.10 patchlevel 6. It is maintained
by David Passmore (Lauren@From the Ashes) and would not exist without
the generous contributions of many individuals. Ideas for features (and
occasionally code) came from many places, including TinyMUSE, and PennMUSH.

We would like to thank the following people:
 
- Dave Peterson (Evinar) who maintained TinyMUSH 2.0 in its later
  incarnations.
 
- TinyMUSH 2.2, and PennMUSH 1.50 for many functions carried over for
  compatibility, and parts of the help text. These are documented as they
  appear in the source code. This code would not be possible without these
  two servers.

- James Callahan (Darkenelf), who contributed many patches, and ideas
  (@teleport/quiet, @readcache fixes, side effect functions,
   many bug fixes)
 
- Chris (Children of the Atom) who had many, many, many ideas and found
  many, many, many bugs, in his own gleeful manner of crashing our site.
 
- Alan Schwartz (Javelin/Paul) and Lydia Leong (Amberyl), whose extended
  mailer from PennMUSH is the basis for MUX's @mail system. Also,
  Brandy (CrystalMUSH) whose +mail system inspired many of the features.
 
- Ethaniel and Kayan Telva (BTech3056) for the basic comsystem and macro code.
 
- Dreamline (Horizons) who helped update the help text.

- Stephen J. Kiernan for the (very alpha) port concentrator code.

- Kalkin(DarkZone) and Harlock(StarWarsII) who extended the comsystem and
  added tons of new commands, which is basically unchanged here.
 
- Kalkin, again, for the basis of the mail alias and guest code, and the
  idea of restarting on a fatal signal.
  
- Airam (Generations) for ideas on the stack and @program code.

- Mike (StarWars), idea for not saving GOING objects, and mail expiration
  code.

- Dean Gaudet, for his user and hostname slave process code.

- The GNU project, for their wonderful database manager, and malloc package.

- Andrew Molitor, for the radix compression library, and some wonderful
  utilities.

- Robby Griffin, whose skill in uncovering obscure bugs has saved everyone
  a lot of time and effort.

TinyMUSH 2.2 Credits
====================


TinyMUSH 2.2 is a continuation of development work done on TinyMUSH 2.0.
TinyMUSH 2.0 is derived from Larry Foard's TinyMUSH (which was itself 
derived from TinyMUD, written by Jim Aspnes). TinyMUSH 2.0, written by
JT Traub (Moonchilde@PernMUSH) and Glenn Crocker (Wizard@TinyCWRU),
was a consolidation of features found in other servers, including
TinyMUSH, PernMUSH, TinyTIM, and, later, PennMUSH.
 
TinyMUSH 2.2 is primarily the work of Jean Marie Diaz (Ambar@PernMUSH),
Deborah Wilson-Hooker (Tyleet@TwoMoons), and Lydia Leong (Amberyl@PernMUSH).
 
Many, many people have contributed to TinyMUSH; our list of "thanks" is
by no means complete.

In addition to the folks thanked in the 2.0 credits, we'd like to
also thank Javelin and Talek, from the PennMUSH crew, for continuing
contributions to the MUSH community and this codebase in particular.

TinyMUSH 2.0 Credits
====================
 
TinyMUSH 2.0 is derived from Larry Foard's TinyMUSH (which was itself derived
from TinyMUD, written by Jim Aspnes).  Ideas for features (and occasionally
code) came from many places, including TinyMUSE, PernMUSH, and TinyTIM.
 
We would like to thank the following people:
 
- Jim Aspnes, for the original TinyMUD (from which TinyMUSH was derived)
 
- Larry Foard, for the original implementation of TinyMUSH.
 
- Marcus Ranum for the original Untermud database layer code, and  Andrew
  Molitor for getting it to work with TinyMUSH.
 
- Andrew Molitor (again) for the VMS port.
 
- Russ(Random) and Jennifer(Moira) Smith, for ideas, comments, and coding
  help.
 
- R'nice(TinyTIM) for more good ideas than we could shake a wand of coding
  at.  (@doing, @edit enhancements, a REAL use command, lotsa minor fixes and
  tweaks)
 
- Coyote(TinyTIM, DungeonMUSH, NarniaMUSH), for finding some nasty bugs and
  NOT using them for evil purposes.
 
- Ambar, Amberyl, Sh'dow, Jellan, and Miritha (all from PernMUSH) for numerous
  bug fixes, enhancements, and ideas.
 
- Sketch(TinyTIM) for rewriting some of the more confusing help file entries.
 
- Hcobb(TinyTIM) and Furie(DungeonMUSH) for inspiring the parser rewrite and
  other security-related fixes and enhancements.
 
- The many other people who have contributed ideas, comments, or complaints
  about bugs.
