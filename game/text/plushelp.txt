& help
 
This is an example of how to write an arbitrary indexed 'help'-like file.
If you wanted to have your '+help' command look at this file, you would
add the following line to your netmush.conf file (or equivalent):
 
helpfile +help text/plushelp.txt
 
See 'wizhelp helpfile' for more details.
 
& +help
 
This is a sample +help entry for '+help +help'.
