& help
 
This is an example of how to write an arbitrary indexed 'help'-like file.
If you wanted to have your '+help' command look at this file, you would
add the following line to your netmush.conf file (or equivalent):
 
helpfile +help text/plushelp.txt
 
The text within the helpfile will be evaluated, i.e., you can use
ANSI substitutions like \%xh and \%xn. If you don't want the text
evaluated, in this example, you would change your conf directive to:
 
raw_helpfile +help text/plushelp.txt
 
See 'wizhelp helpfile' and 'wizhelp raw_helpfile' for more details.
 
& +help
 
This is a sample +help entry for '+help +help'.
 
& aliased help entries
& aliased entries
 
This is a sample +help entry with two names: '+help aliased help entries'
and '+help aliased entries'.
