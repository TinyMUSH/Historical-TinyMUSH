& bugs

Recent bugfixes:
 
@readcache now frees the memory that was allocated when it reads new files
into memory. Many buffer fubars have been fixed. The distribution should be
pretty stable.
 
& parser
 
HA! We didn't rewrite the parser. It does, however, handle ANSI pretty well.
Bleeding should never take place (unless you are on a client that doesn't
know what ANSI_NORMAL is). A few speed improvements have been made as well.
 
& foo
 
GAWD that was a bad joke.
