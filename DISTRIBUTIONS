TinyMUX 1.2.0 is available from:
	ftp://ranger.range.orst.edu/pub/cota/source/tinymux-1.2.0.tar.gz

TinyMUX 1.2 is the first TinyMUX package using a new, more flexible
method of beta testing and distribution. Starting with 1.2, TinyMUX will
split into two versions which will be maintained at the same time. The minor
version number (1.x) will indicate which type the package is. If you are
familiar with the distribution method for Linux kernels, they are very
similar.

Even numbered versions, beginning with 1.2, will be know as the 'stable'
distributions. The only changes and patches to these distributions will be
bug fixes. No new features will be added.

Odd numbered versions, beginning with 1.3, will be 'beta' distributions.
These will be under constant development, and while bug fixes will be
distributed for them, new bugs will likely crop up with changes and new
features.

When the beta distribution finally moves towards relative stability, the
cycle will begin anew, and version numbers will be incremented. Databases
between the stable and beta distributions will be interchangable, so users
are encouraged to try out the beta versions.
