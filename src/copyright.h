 *
 * TinyMUSH 2.2 is the result of the efforts of many, many people. A few

 * and Dave McCracken for much in the way of code and advice; Alan Schwartz
 * and T. Alexander "Talek" Popiel (PennMUSH) and David Passmore (TinyMUX)
 * for ideas and code; and John Batzel (and the rest of the PernMUSH
 * wizcrew) for beta-testing, many ideas, and a lot of patience.

 *
 * TinyMUSH 3.0 Credits:
 *
 * Many people contributed to the end result which is TinyMUSH 3.0. They
 * include:
 *
 *	- Fred "Iago" Hicks, for the logo
 *	- Deborah Wilson-Hooker, T. Alexander Popiel, JT Traub, and
 *	  Andrew Molitor, as always
 *	- The players of From the Ashes, Babylon 5: The Last Best Hope,
 *	  and Blood of Amber, for alpha testing
 *	- The TinyMUX and Hogs lists, and the players of the Godlike Edge,
 *	  for everything
 *
 * ... and everyone who participated in the religious wars between TinyMUSH
 *     and TinyMUX, which ultimately spurred our decision to merge them. :)
